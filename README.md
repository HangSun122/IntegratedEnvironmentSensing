# Project Background
In today's fast-paced and technology-driven world, people are becoming increasingly conscious of their well-being and the impact of their surroundings on their health. The primary objective of developing this product is to empower individuals to take control of their sleep environment, ensuring optimal conditions for restful sleep and overall well-being. Numerous studies have demonstrated the significant impact of the bedroom environment on sleep quality and overall health. Factors such as temperature, humidity, noise levels, and air quality play vital roles in determining the quality and duration of sleep. By providing accurate and real-time monitoring of these parameters, our Smart Home Bedroom Environment Monitoring System seeks to address these concerns and enable users to make informed decisions for their sleep environment.
